## About
The libft project is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of fundamental C programming concepts and provide you with a library that you can reuse in future projects. It includes implementations of standard library functions, as well as additional functions that can be useful for string manipulation, memory management, linked lists, and more.

The library is written in C and is thoroughly tested to ensure the accuracy and reliability of each function. It serves as an excellent resource for enhancing your programming skills and developing a solid foundation in the C programming language.

## Getting Started
To get started with the libft project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/libft.git
```
2. Navigate to the libft directory:
```
cd libft
```
3. Compile the library:
```
make
```
4. Use the library in your projects:
- Include the header file in your C files:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```
- Link the library during compilation:
```
gcc -o your_program your_program.c -L. -lft
```

## Documentation
The libft library comes with a detailed documentation that describes each function and its usage. You can find the documentation in the [`libft.h`](libft.h) header file, where the function prototypes and descriptions are provided.

## Contributing
Contributions to the libft project are welcome! If you find any bugs, issues, or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Additionally, you can fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Please ensure that your contributions align with the coding style and standards used in the project.
